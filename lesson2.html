                            <b>• Preventive Maintenance. <br>
                                • Predictive Maintenance. <br>
                                • Corrective Maintenance. <br> <br></b>

                            <b>1. Preventive Maintenance:</b> Schedule of planned maintenance actions aimed at the
                            prevention of breakdowns and failures. <br>
                            • Main goal is to preserve and enhance equipment reliability. <br>
                            • Anything which increases life of equipment, and helps it runs more efficiently. <br>
                            • Benefits of PM: <br>
                            1. Increases life of equipment <br>
                            2. Reduces failures and breakdowns. <br>
                            3. Reduces costly down time. <br>
                            4. Decreases cost of replacement. <br> <br>
                            • Only trained, qualified maintenance personnel should perform PM’s. <br> <br>

                            <b>Predictive Maintenance (PdM):</b> Techniques that help determine the
                            condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed.
                            <br>
                            • Main goal of the Predictive Maintenance is minimize disruption of normal system
                            operations, while allowing for budgeted, scheduled repairs. <br>
                            • Benefits of Predictive Maintenance: <br>
                            1. Provides increased operational life. <br>
                            2. Results in decrease of downtime. <br>
                            3. Allows for scheduled downtime. <br>
                            4. Allows for money to be budgeted for repairs. <br>
                            5. Lowers need for extensive parts inventory. <br><br>

                            • Predictive maintenance can be done by a contracted, specialized technician. <br> <br>

                            <b>3. Corrective Maintenance:</b> Repair of equipment/machinery in order to bring it back to
                            original operational condition. <br>
                            • It can be done by the system expert. <br> <br>

                            <b>Post Implementation Activities</b> <br>
                            • The goal of the post implementation activities is to institutionalize the use of the new
                            system – that is, to make it the normal, accepted, routine way of performing the business
                            processes. <br>
                            • Three key post implementation activities are: <br>
                            1. System Support <br>
                            2. System Maintenance <br>
                            3. Project support <br> <br>

                            <b>1. System Support:</b> Once the system is installed and performed the change management
                            activities, the system is officially turned over to the operational group. <br> <br>

                            • Operational group is responsible for the operation of the system, whereas the project team
                            is responsible for the development of the system.<br>
                            • Operational group peoples are closely involved in the installation activities.<br>
                            • Providing system support means helping the users to use the system.<br>
                            • Providing answers to questions and helping users understand how to perform a certain
                            function; this is as on demand training.<br>
                            • Online support is the most common form of on demand training.<br>
                            • FAQs – enable users to find answer without contacting a person.<br>
                            • Most organization provides a help desk – to talk with a person who can answer queries.<br>
                            • Help desk can be operated by level-1 support staff – who have very broad computer skills
                            and are able to respond wide range of requests.<br>
                            • Level 2 peoples are application expert people can be supporting to run the help desk with
                            level 1 people.<br> <br> <br>

                            <b>2. System Maintenance</b> <br>
                            • Is the process of refining the system to make sure it continues to meet business needs.
                            <br>
                            • Over a systems' lifetime more money and efforts are devoted to system maintenance than to
                            the initial development of the system, because system continues to change and evolve as it
                            is used. <br>
                            • Three types of Maintenance: <br>

                            1. Preventive Maintenance (PM) – Greasing, Oil, filters. <br>
                            2. Predictive Maintenance (PDM) - Inspection. <br>
                            3. Corrective Maintenance. – Repairs. <br> <br> <br>


                            <b>3. Project Support </b> <br>
                            It provides an administrative role in a PRINCE2 project environment. On smaller projects
                            this role can be fulfilled by the Project Manager , but larger projects generally require a
                            full Project Support Team. Project Support can be anything from advice and assistance to
                            administrative services such as collecting and compiling data. A particularly important
                            support feature is Configuration Management which controls the assets of the project. <br>
                            <br>

                            The duties associated with the PRINCE2 Project Support role normally defaults to the Project
                            Manager. However, where appropriate, the Project Manager can delegate some of this
                            responsibility. <br>
                            Responsibilities Project Support responsibilities that may be delegated include: <br>
                            • Administrative services <br>
                            • Advice and guidance on project management tools or configuration management <br>
                            • Specialist functions like planning or risk management. <br>
                            • Administering configuration management procedures of the Change Control Approach .
                            In some organizations, a temporary “project office” may be set up to supply some or all
                            Project Support functions for a particular project. <br>
                            Project Support and Project Assurance roles should be undertaken by separate individuals to
                            ensure that Project Assurance is independent. <br> <br>

                            Operating Systems Supporting Administration <br> <br>
                            <b>• 1982 - Sun Microsystems founded. Sun Microsystems, Inc.,</b> former American
                            manufacturer of computer workstations, servers, and software. In 2010 the company was
                            purchased by Oracle Corporation, a leading provider of database management systems. <br>
                            <br>

                            Founding And Growth <br> <br>

                            Andreas Bechtolsheim, William Joy, Vinod Khosla, and Scott McNealy founded Sun Microsystems,
                            Inc., in 1982 for the purpose of selling low-cost high-performance desktop computers running
                            the UNIX operating system. Those computer workstations found immediate acceptance among
                            engineers, software developers, and scientists who benefited from having dedicated machines
                            rather than sharing more expensive minicomputers or mainframe computer systems. <br> <br>

                            Unlike its Fortune 500 competitors, Sun did not have revenue from other sources to fund
                            development of its computer workstations. This meant that the company needed hundreds of
                            millions of dollars in start-up investments, as well as large purchase agreements, in order
                            to develop a hardware-manufacturing infrastructure and to attract top-flight hardware and
                            software engineers. In 1983 the company signed a multimillion-dollar original equipment
                            manufacturer (OEM) agreement with Computer vision Corporation, a designer of computer-aided
                            design and engineering programs. This was the first of many large OEM agreements through
                            which Sun built computers for companies that sold the workstations under their own labels.

                            <b>• PC Based Unix - solaris, SCO Unix, FreeBSD, NetBSD</b>The UNIX operating system was
                            created more than four decades ago at AT&T’s Bell Laboratories. With continuous development
                            since its inception, UNIX has made its presence from tiny embedded devices to servers and
                            supercomputers. This article provides a brief history, philosophy, specification of UNIX and
                            discusses the top ten operating systems of the UNIX systems. <br> <br>

                            In terms of evaluation of operating systems, UNIX has a long history. In the 1960s, MIT
                            along with General Electric (GE) and AT&T’s Bell Laboratories worked on a co-operative
                            research project to create a new operating system called MULTICS (Multiplexed Operating and
                            Computing System). Multics was conceived as a general purpose time-sharing utility to
                            support electricity and telephone services. It had numerous features; few of them are high
                            availability, hierarchical file system, security to modular design (allowing adding
                            resources while the system is running), command processor (like shell), dynamic linking,
                            online reconfiguration. <br> <br>

                            Multics was developed initially for the GE-645 mainframe and later Honeywell continued it on
                            its Honeywell 6180 machines. However, Bell Labs pulled out of the MULTICS project and
                            started development of a new operating system for PDP-7 machine. Ken Thompson (one of the
                            Multics developers) joined with Dennis Ritchie and team members to develop new multi-tasking
                            operating system called UNICS (Uniplexed Operating and Computing System). This is considered
                            the first UNIX operating system. UNIX was designed to be portable, multi-tasking and
                            multi-user in a time-sharing configuration. It is said that the person who coined the word
                            UNIX is Brian Kernighan. The word UNIX is pronounced as yoo-niks, not yoo-neeks or
                            yoo-nucks. In 1972, UNIX was rewritten in the C programming language after porting the code
                            from assembly language making UNIX a much more portable. <br> <br>

                            The AT&T’s Bell Labs licensedUNIXto outside parties from the late 1970s.UNIX source code was
                            made available for free. This opened gates to have different flavors of UNIX operating
                            systems based on the needs. There are primarily two base versions of UNIX available: System
                            V and Berkley Software Distribution (BSD). The majority of all UNIX flavors are built on one
                            of these two versions. In the early 1980s, the impact of Unix in academic circles led to
                            large-scale adoption ofUNIXby commercial vendors including HP-UX, Solaris, AIX, and Xenix.
                            With more than four decades of constant development, UNIX emerged as a successful operating
                            system running from tiny embedded devices, servers, desktop to supercomputers. <br> <br>

                            Solaris is a UNIX based operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems with roots
                            in the BSD operating system and AT&T System V. The earlier operating system of Sun
                            Microsystems was known as SunOS. The first version of SunOS basing on BSD roots was
                            published in 1982. The Sun introduced scalable processor architecture (SPARC) chip which
                            allowed creating powerful, reliable yet inexpensive machines.Up to the version 3.x, this
                            operating system was called SunOS, and with the version 4.0, Sun called SunOS with Solaris.
                            The Solaris 2.0 release (SunOS 5.0) basing on the UNIX system V release 4 (replacing BSD)
                            was published in 1992. Sun released Solaris 2.4, supporting both SPARC and x86 systems from
                            a unified source code base. OpenSolaris – a project initiated by Sun Microsystems,
                            discontinued after the acquisition by Oracle. In September 2017, it is rumored that Oracle
                            had laid off the Solaris core development staff, indicating Oracle’s non-interest in Solaris
                            development. <br> <br>

                            FreeBSD is a free open-source operating system roots back to original Berkeley Software
                            Distribution (BSD). FreeBSD maintains a feature-complete operating system with the
                            full-fledged kernel, device drivers, utilities, and documentation. Two engineers William
                            Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz ported BSD to the Intel-based 80386 processors and called it with
                            name 386BSD. However, a group of 386BSD users created a new branch and named it with
                            FreeBSD. The first version of FreeBSD was released in November 1993. It is said that Apple
                            OS is based on FreeBSD. As a general-purpose operating system, FreeBSD is used in various
                            scenarios as both desktop and server environments. <br> <br>

                            NetBSD is an open source operating system based out of legacy 4.4BSD and 386BSD code base.
                            Its motto is a highly portable operating system. Armed with a specialized hardware
                            abstraction layer, the NetBSD splits its device drivers into machine dependent and machine
                            independent components hiding the hardware access details. NetBSD supported Symmetric
                            multiprocessing from its release 2.0 in year 2004.Thanks to its code clarity, careful
                            design, and portability features, NetBSD being used in large-scale server systems, desktop
                            systems, handheld devices and in embedded systems. <br> <br>

                            Xinuos OpenServer, previously SCO UNIX and SCO Open Desktop, is a closed source computer
                            operating system developed by Santa Cruz Operation, later acquired by SCO Group, and now
                            owned by Xinuos. Early versions of OpenServer were based on UNIX System V, while the later
                            OpenServer 10 is based on FreeBSD. Xenix is a discontinued version of a UNIX based operating
                            system licensed by Microsoft in the late 1970s. Impressed by UNIX popularity, Microsoft
                            purchased a license from AT&T. It may be surprised to some people to know that Microsoft
                            once owned UNIX rights. However Microsoft was not involved in selling Xenix directly to the
                            customers rather it licensed to companies like IBM, Intel, SCO etc to port the operating
                            system on their proprietary processors. Unable to face the competition after break up with
                            AT&T, Microsoft decided to transfer the ownership to SCO who released Xenix with new brand
                            name SCO UNIX. SCO UNIX did not sustain after its last version V.2.3.4, released in 1991.

                            <b>• Linux - Linus Torvalds (Finland) 1991. Free/Open.</b>Linux began in 1991 as a personal
                            project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: to create a new free operating system kernel. The
                            resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the
                            initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C files
                            under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more
                            than 23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the GNU General Public
                            License v2. <br> <br> <br>

                            <b>• Red Hat Linux – Commercial Version</b>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (often abbreviated to
                            RHEL) is a Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market. Red Hat
                            Enterprise Linux is released in server versions for x86-64, Power ISA, ARM64, and IBM Z and
                            a desktop version for x86-64. All of Red Hat's official support and training, together with
                            the Red Hat Certification Program, focuses on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform. <br>
                            <br>

                            The first version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to bear the name originally came onto the
                            market as "Red Hat Linux Advanced Server". In 2003, Red Hat rebranded Red Hat Linux Advanced
                            Server to "Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS" and added two more variants, Red Hat Enterprise
                            Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS. <br> <br>

                            Red Hat uses strict trademark rules to restrict free re-distribution of their officially
                            supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux but still freely provides its source code.
                            Third-party derivatives can be built and redistributed by stripping away non-free components
                            like Red Hat's trademarks. Examples include community-supported distributions like CentOS
                            and Scientific Linux and commercial forks like Oracle Linux. <br> <br>

                            Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server subscription is available at no cost for development
                            purposes. Developers need to register for the Red Hat Developer Program and agree to license
                            terms forbidding production use. This free developer subscription was announced on March 31,
                            2016. <br> <br>

                            There are also "Academic" editions of the Desktop and Server variants. They are offered to
                            schools and students, are less expensive, and are provided with Red Hat technical support as
                            an optional extra. Web support based on the number of customer contacts can be purchased
                            separately. <br> <br>

                            It is often assumed the branding ES, AS, and WS stand for "Entry-level Server", "Advanced
                            Server" and "Work Station", respectively. The reason for this is that the ES product is
                            indeed the company's base enterprise server product, while AS is the more advanced product.
                            However, nowhere on its site or in its literature does Red Hat say what AS, ES, and WS stand
                            for. <br> <br>

                            In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 there are new editions that substitute former Red Hat
                            Enterprise Linux AS/ES/WS/Desktop: <br>

                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform (former AS)<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux (former ES) (limited to two CPUs)<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation and Multi-OS option<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Workstation option (former WS)<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop with Multi-OS option<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop (former Desktop)
                            Red Hat had also announced its Red Hat Global Desktop Linux edition "for emerging markets".
                            RHEL 4, 3, and prior releases had four variants:<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS for mission-critical/enterprise computer systems.<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES for supported network servers<br>
                            • Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS for technical power user enterprise desktops for
                            high-performance computing<br>
                            • Red Hat Desktop for multiple deployments of single-user desktops for enterprises.<br> <br>

                            <b>• Debian, Ubuntu, another popular version of Linux (freeware)</b> <br>
                            <b>Debian</b> <br><br>
                            If you are still a fan of the old sysvinit, then Devuan might just do the trick for you.
                            Devuan is a Debian fork that is designed to be as close to Debian as conceivably possible.
                            Its latest version is Beowulf 3.0.0 that is based on Debian 10. In addition, Devuan provides
                            support for the ARM community with bootable ARM images. <br><br> <br>

                            <b>Ubuntu</b> <br> <br>
                            Arguably one of the most widely used free and opensource Linux distro especially by desktop
                            enthusiasts, Ubuntu requires no introduction. Since its initial release by Canonical in
                            2004, Ubuntu has made huge leaps to extend its support to servers, IoT devices, and cloud
                            technologies. <br> <br>

                            The latest version, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, dubbed Focal Fossa, is its latest Long Term Release
                            (LTS) and will receive support until April 2025. Ubuntu 20.04 ships with a brand new Yaru
                            theme which has 3 variants (Dark, light, and standard), GNOME 3.36 with new-look polished
                            icons, improved ZFS support, fractional scaling for enhanced displays, and multiple default
                            Apps such as Firefox, Thunderbird, and LibreOffice suite. <br> <br>

                            Most notable is Ubuntu’s push for snaps over the traditional APT package manager. A snap is
                            a software package that ships with all the libraries and dependencies required to function
                            as expected. Though not intended to entirely replace debs, snaps have managed to resolve the
                            issue with software availability. <br> <br>
                            
                            As opposed to a Debian package that requires dependencies from external sources, a snap
                            package comes pre-packaged with all the dependencies and can be readily installed on every
                            Ubuntu release that supports snap (Ubuntu 16.04 and later versions). <br><br><br>
