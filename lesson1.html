                            Information Services (IS) department. In a smaller group they may be shared by a few System
                            Administrators, or even a single person. <br> <br>

                            • Database Administrator <br>

                            A <b>database administrator</b> (DBA) maintains a database system, and is responsible for
                            the
                            integrity of the data and the efficiency and performance of the system. <br> <br>

                            A <b>network administrator</b> maintains network infrastructure such as switches and
                            routers, and
                            diagnoses problems with these or with the behavior of network-attached computers.
                            A security administrator is a specialist in computer and network security, including the
                            administration of security devices such as firewalls, as well as consulting on general
                            security measures. <br> <br>

                            A <b>web administrator</b> maintains web server services (such as IIS or Apache) that allow
                            for
                            internal or external access to web sites. Tasks include managing multiple sites,
                            administering security, and configuring necessary components and software. Responsibilities
                            may also include software change management. <br> <br>

                            <b>Technical support</b> staff respond to individual users' difficulties with computer
                            systems, provide instructions and sometimes training, and diagnose and solve common problems. <br>
                            <br>

                            A <b>computer operator</b> performs routine maintenance and upkeep, such as changing backup tapes
                            or replacing failed drives in a RAID array. Such tasks usually require physical presence in
                            the room with the computer; and while less skilled than says admin tasks require a similar
                            level of trust, since the operator has access to possibly sensitive data.
